Deploying frontend on S3, backend on EC2 and configuring database of RDS
This setup is a full-stack web application deployment on AWS, where:

Frontend (React) is hosted on S3 as a static website.

Backend (Node.js + Express) is deployed on EC2.

Database (MySQL) is hosted on RDS.

Communication happens over the internet between the frontend (S3), backend (EC2), and database (RDS).
